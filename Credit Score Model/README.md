# Credit Score Model.
- This repo contains all the files used to build a credit score model.
## Data Analysis
1. #### Loan Distribution.
- Firstly I analysed the distrbution for the loan amount, funded amount and funded amount investor.

![distribution](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/distribution.png)
There is a similar distribution between the 3 amount. Tells us that most of the requested loans where funded by the investors.

2. #### Loan Issued over the Years.
- What's the loan issue rate like since 2013?
![loans issued](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/loan%20issued.png)

There has been a general increase in loans issued from 2013.
- Notice that there's a steady increase in loans issued before mid 2015.
- From mid 2015 we can see a massive spike and a quick drop follows and this pattern is repeated till mid 2016.
- Post 2016 sees a more decent sideways movement in loans issued.

The general increase in loans can be as a result of good economic environments and as well as investors profitting from the interest on loans.

3. #### Let's look at the Interest Rate over the Years.
- Is there an Increase in interest rate?
![Interest Rate](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/interest%20rate.png)

- Pre 2013 sees a rise and drop in interest rate.
- On a more general note, we don't see a rise in interest. 
- Mid 2013 shows a steady drop in interest rate from  ~15.3% in mid 2013 to  ~12.3% in early 2016.
- There's a spke in interest rate in mid 2016 to  ~13.5%. This creates a sideways movement till a quick drop in 2018 to  ~15.3%.
- From 2018 we see a steady movement in the rates. The movement see interest rate staying between 13% and 12.5%.

I don't think the drop in interest rate can reduce the number on investors that are wlling and ready to fund more peer to peer loans.
But one thing is sure that it can result n more persons coming to get loans, this in turn will result in more profits for the investors funding the loans as long as people are able to fully pay back their loans.

4. #### Loan Status
- Are People Defaulting on their Loans?
![loan status](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/loan%20status.png)
- This looks good. We see that 48% have fully paid back the loans while 39% are current on their loans.
- Fully paid and Current are indicators of good loans, we can say that ~87% have paid back the loans. This is higher than I expected.
- Looking at the bad loans. We see that 13% of individuals either defaulted on the loans, are late toward payment or have loans charged off.
- This is high in some sense but the numbers can be brought down if the late payments come through.

Overall this shows a good indicator of loans having a high chance of being payed back but can also hurt some investors.

5. #### Loan Purpose
- Why Do People Take Loans?
![purpose](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/purpose.png)

- It's no surprise here that debt consolidaton and Credit Card refinancing are the major reasons why people take loans.
- These purpose account for over 70% of the loans collected.
- Home inprovements seems to be another major reason why people take loans.
- Small busnesses, purchases, car, moving, wedding education and others are also on the list.

6. #### Income Distribution
- Are High Income Earners Taking Loans?
![high earners](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/highearners.png)

High Income earners are chosen as individuals with annual income above $150k.
- We can see that the top 10 high income earners are Directors, VP's, CEO's, General Managers and Owners etc.
- Directors top the list followed by VP's and Presidents.
- Other high earners are Physician, Attorneys, Sales, Managers.

- What about Low Annual Income?
![low income](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/low%20earners.png)
- We can also find Onwers, Sales and Managers on this list.
- Others are Registered Nurse, Office Managers, Drivers, Teachers, Supervisors and Project Managers.

7. #### Income Distribution For Top-Top Earners.

![top income](https://github.com/geewynn/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/Credit%20Score%20Model/images/high%20income.png)
- For the top 4 earners, we can see that the annual income is skewed to the left, this shows that majority of the earners earn between
$150k to $500k annualy.
- The outliers shows the highest annual earners for the top earners and their annual income are as follows.
  - Director is $8 million.
